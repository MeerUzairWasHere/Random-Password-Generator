# Random Password Generator
This git repository contains the source code for a web-based random password generator application, which was built as an exercise on Scrimba.com. The application generates a random password based on user input for password length and character type.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and responsive across different devices. The code is organized into modular components for ease of maintenance and extensibility.

The password generator allows users to specify the length of their desired password, and choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password is displayed in real-time and can be copied to the clipboard with a single click.

The repository includes detailed documentation for the application, including a user guide and developer API reference. Contributions and feedback are welcome and encouraged!
